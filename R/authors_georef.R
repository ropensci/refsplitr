#' Extracts the lat and long for each address from authors_clean
#'
#' \code{authors_georef} This function takes the final author list from 
#' refine_authors, and calculates the lat long of the addresses. 
#' It does this by feeding the addresses into data science toolkit. 
#' In order to maximize effectiveness and mitigate errors in parsing addresses
#' We run this multiple times creating addresses in different ways
#' in hopes that the google georeferencing API can recognize an address
#' 1st. University, city, zipcode, country
#' 2nd. City, zipcode, country
#' 3rd. city, country
#' 4th. University, country
#' 
#' The output is a list with three data.frames
#' \code{addresses} is a data frame with all information from 
#' refine_authors plus new location columns and calculated lat longs.
#' \code{missing addresses} is a data frame with all addresses could
#' not be geocoded
#' \code{addresses} is a data frame like \code{addresses} except
#' the missing addresses are gone.
#'
#' @param data dataframe from `authors_refine()`
#' @param address_column name of column in quotes where the addresses are
#' #' @param google_api if FALSE georeferencing is carried out with the 
#' tidygeocoder package (geocode() with  method = 'osm'). if TRUE geocoding 
#' is done with the google maps API. Defaults to FALSE.
