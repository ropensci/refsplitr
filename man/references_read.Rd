\title{Reads Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge/Science and ISI reference export files (both .txt or .ciw format accepted)}
\usage{
references_read(data = ".", dir = FALSE, include_all = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the location of the file or files to be imported. This can be either the absolute or
relative name of the file (for a single file) or folder (for multiple files stored in the same folder;
used in conjunction with `dir = TRUE``). If left blank it is assumed the location is the working directory.}

\item{dir}{if FALSE it is assumed a single file is to be imported.
Set to TRUE if importing multiple files (the path to the folder in which files are stored is set with `data=``;
all files in the folder will be imported). Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{include_all}{if FALSE only a subset of commonly used fields from references records are imported.
If TRUE then all fields from the reference records are imported. Defaults to FALSE.
The additional data fields included if \code{include_all=TRUE}: CC, CH, CL, CT, CY, FX, GA, J9,

\description{
\code{references_read} This function reads Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge
and ISI format reference data files into an R-friendly data format. The resulting dataframe
is the argument for the refsplitr function \code{authors_clean()}.
}
\examples{
## If a single files is being imported from a folder called "data" located in an RStudio Project:
## imported_refs<-references_read(data = './data/refs.txt', dir = FALSE, include_all=FALSE)

## If multiple files are being imported from a folder named "heliconia" nested within a folder
## called "data" located in an RStudio Project:
## heliconia_refs<-references_read(data = './data/heliconia', dir = TRUE, include_all=FALSE)

## To load the Web of Science records used in the examples in the documentation
BITR_data_example <- system.file("extdata", "BITR_test.txt", package = "refsplitr")
BITR <- references_read(BITR_data_example)
